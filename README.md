# COVID19_Clinical_Test_Interpretability
Presenting some finding, based on the results of laboratory tests commonly done for a suspected COVID-19 case during visit to Emergency Room (ER) to show how an analytical approach caters for the given situation using Deep Learning Approach and interpretability Model, so as to fasten the decision making process for Front Line Health professionals



## Insights

- The case study gives a complete data analytics approach using advanced techniques to cater for the given scenario.

- This gives a helicopter view of how a data-driven decision making helps in solving the crisis at hand. If well-distributed data is provided to the author, some of the shortcoming can be reduced. ( Discussed in the Notebook)

- The main concern is to control the outbreak of this pandemic, this approach enables all the front-line workers to spread out and do accurate rapid testing.

- It also caters in increasing number of mobile test units, even though the number of health workers is less, the clinical test kit is available now in a mobile test kit version and with this analytical approach, it empowers the other responsible frontline workers to take the test and recognize the results accurately. 

- Not only that we have seen there are case were  False Negative comes, in those scenarios one can remotely consult the health workers. 

- As we see rapid testing is one of the good strategies to strategically stop the spread, these type of analytics-enabled mobile test kits might have to install in several places like airports, schools and offices, to stop the second wave of COVID-19 in countries like Australia where it has successfully flattened the curve. (Stevens, 2020)

- There is some limitation when it comes to modelling and data aspects of the case study, the data set unbalanced.which gives us the limitation of less learning exposure of model to positive data set and also even interpretability model will not be accurate with False Negative patients, which is also a serious matter for concern.
